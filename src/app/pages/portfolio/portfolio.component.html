                                        Hi, I’m Hitesh, a MEAN Stack Developer with 2 years of experience in building dynamic, scalable web applications. My journey began with mastering the fundamentals of web development, such as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, which laid the foundation for my transition into backend development with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="lead">
                                        I started developing full-stack solutions using the MEAN stack, enabling me to create powerful applications that are both user-friendly and efficient. Currently, I’m working on a comprehensive on-demand application designed for service and taxi bookings. This multi-functional platform allows users to book home services, such as cleaning or repairs, as well as taxi rides—all within a seamless user experience.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="lead">
                                        The application is built entirely with the MEAN stack, offering a smooth experience for both users and service providers. To ensure scalability and reliability, I deploy my applications on AWS, utilizing EC2 instances for hosting, S3 buckets for file storage, and NGINX for web serving. Additionally, I’ve integrated Cloudflare for enhanced security and performance.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="lead">
                                        I specialize in building tailored on-demand solutions that not only meet client requirements but also exceed user expectations, ensuring a seamless experience from start to finish. I am proud to have been recognized with the <i>"Bright Beginner"</i> award from Elluminati L.L.C-FZ in December 2022, symbolizing my hard work and passion in this field. This honor motivates me to aim higher and inspire others, reinforcing my commitment to delivering high-quality solutions in web application development.

                                        I focus on providing high-quality, client-centered solutions by continuously iterating based on user feedback and requirements. I believe in collaborating closely with clients to ensure that the final product truly aligns with their vision and goals. Whether working on service booking platforms or taxi applications, I make sure the end result is both functional and user-friendly.

                                        Beyond the technical aspects, I am deeply passionate about continuous learning. I stay updated on the latest industry trends in web development and actively seek opportunities to expand my knowledge, whether through online courses, industry blogs, or collaboration with other developers. My goal is to remain adaptable and grow with every project, bringing fresh ideas and solutions to the table.

                                        Outside of coding, I’m an avid cricket fan, drawing inspiration from Virat Kohli’s relentless pursuit of excellence and teamwork. His passion for the game drives me to bring the same level of dedication and commitment to my projects.
